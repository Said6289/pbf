# Position Based Fluids

![showcase](showcase.gif)

A relatively simple implementation of [Position Based Fluids](https://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf)
by Miles Macklin and Matthias MÃ¼ller.
This is still very much a work in progress, as it doesn't fully implement the algorithm.

## Building

The code depends on [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and OpenGL. The Makefile
in this repo has only been tested on Linux. The threading uses pthreads right
now, but the SDL threading abstraction could be used in the future
to be able to build on Windows.

Building with the Makefile should be pretty straightforward:
```bash
$ make
```

## User Interaction

Holding the left mouse button will add a force to all particles proprtional
to the distance between a particle and the mouse location, which can be used
to play around with the fluid.
